### Introduction to the Data
From "Data Analysis Project Information":

The data set is comprised of 651 randomly sampled movies produced and released before 2016.

Some of these variables are only there for informational purposes and do not make any sense to include in a statistical analysis. It is up to you to decide which variables are meaningful and which should be omitted. For example information in the the actor1 through actor5 variables was used to determine whether the movie casts an actor or actress who won a best actor or actress Oscar.

You might also choose to omit certain observations or restructure some of the variables to make them suitable for answering your research questions.

When you are fitting a model you should also be careful about collinearity, as some of these variables may be dependent on each other.


### The Scripts
This project feautures a RMarkdown document produced in RStudio and knitted to HTML. Please view the .html, .Rmd, or .md file for an overview of both the assignment questions and my responses.

Project coded by Connor Lenio - released into the public domain for educational purposes in 2017.
